                        I used the Brute Force topMatch, topMatches, and weightOf codes in Autocomplete.java because
                        I feel like it isn't cheating to use code that's given to us in the files.

Impressions: This laboratory assignment wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be to complete but the deliverable
was very challenging because it made me inspect my code and analyze the complexities for the first time since the
data structures course here. It was very satisfying to see the differences between my code and BruteForce / Binary Search
time complexities.
